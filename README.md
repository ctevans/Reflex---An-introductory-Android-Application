# Reflex---An-introductory-Android-Application
Android application done in Java using Android Studio

A very basic application that records user response times in a buzz-timer response fashion, also includes methods to have multiplayer where many other people can compete to hit their individual buzzers in the application. 

Please note: This was a very early project of mine, and sadly lacks proper design patterns, TDD, etc.
